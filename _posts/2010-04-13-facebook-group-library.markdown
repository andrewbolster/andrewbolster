I am sick and tired of seeing 'so and so joined [SOMETHING COOL EVERYONE SHOULD SEE](http://www.facebook.com/pages/Top-10-Stupid-but-still-in-act-British-Laws/117836708227885)' only to check out the group and see its behind a join-wall. so I'm starting my own library of pointless Facebook  joinwall groups along with alternate source material and a brief of what is behind the joinwall. Affectionately known as [FGL](http://andrewbolster.info/facebook-group-library/). Check it out and let me know what groups you want exposed.
