Jeff Han, a researcher at NYU,  surpassed himself again with the most [georgous multitouch display interface I've ever seen](http://www.ted.com/index.php/talks/view/id/65) (surface/iphone eat your heart out). I always love watching TED talks, and if anyone really wants to see a good reason why Powerpoint should be killed, I'd recomment Hans Roslings talk on global poverty [here](http://www.ted.com/index.php/speakers/view/id/90)


Please at least pretend to click my ads. I know they're a joke, but still, it dont cost ya anything!
