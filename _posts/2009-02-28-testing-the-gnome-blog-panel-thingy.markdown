title: Testing The Gnome Blog Panel Thingy
---


So, I've decided that each weekend i wanna have a fiddling project and document it for the blog. This week I'm gonna do a free bsd 7.1 install on the wreckage that is my old laptop. I'll update when i get pictures ( Sorry, no VGA scanner, digital camera will have to do)
