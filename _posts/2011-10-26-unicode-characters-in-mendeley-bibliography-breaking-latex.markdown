title: Unicode Characters in Mendeley Bibliography Breaking Latex?
---


[![]({{ BASE_PATH}}/uploads/2011/10/oem.png)]({{ BASE_PATH }}/2011/10/unicode-characters-in-mendeley-bibliography-breaking-latex/oem/)I use Mendeley for my reference and citation management.

I use TexClipse for (most) of my $latex \LaTeX$ editing, ViM otherwise.

I use Xelatex / pdflatex for project building.

These don't always work so well together.Â 

One issue I came across was that Mendeley can insert some weird Unicode whitespace characters that 'disappear' in TexClipse / Vim, but break xelatex/pdflatex.

Easy solution: set the project encoding in TexClipse to ignore these characters upon pasting.

Right click on your project -> Properties - > set Text File Encoding to US-ASCII; Apply

Job Done; No more Unicode woes!
