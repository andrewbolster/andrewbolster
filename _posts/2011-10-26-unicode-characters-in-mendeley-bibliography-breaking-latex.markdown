I use TexClipse for (most) of my $latex \LaTeX$ editing, ViM otherwise.

I use Xelatex / pdflatex for project building.

These don't always work so well together.Â 

One issue I came across was that Mendeley can insert some weird Unicode whitespace characters that 'disappear' in TexClipse / Vim, but break xelatex/pdflatex.

Easy solution: set the project encoding in TexClipse to ignore these characters upon pasting.

Right click on your project -> Properties - > set Text File Encoding to US-ASCII; Apply

Job Done; No more Unicode woes!
