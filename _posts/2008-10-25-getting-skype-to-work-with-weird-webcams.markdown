title: Getting Skype to work with weird webcams.

I'll keep this as informative.
If your webcam works in ubuntu (I'm running the 8.10 RC atm, fantastic btw) under cheese but not with skype, I did a bit of digging and cheese uses v4l2 (the 'new' webcam api) which inherently screws up skype that uses v4l1.

So, its easy enough since i came across [this post](http://forum.skype.com/index.php?showtopic=218861&view=findpost&p=995701) and after chasing up my own system locations (this guy must be on 64bit, but i didnt ask) dead easy, instead of in the terminal going
# skype
**UPDATE:25/4/9**

After a fresh installÂ  jaunty i discovered i was missing a step

Need to install lib32v4l-0 and lib32v4l-dev (i think the -dev is unnessary but i install them anyway)

look in your library directories (/usr/lib/ or /usr/lib32/) for v4l1compat.so,

eg " find /usr/lib\* -name '\*v4lcompat.so' "
{%highlight bash%}
# LD_PRELOAD=/path/to/v4l1compat.so skype
{%endhighlight%}
this, obv, preloads that library forcing skype to use teh right interface library.

If my explanation is wrong please correct me
