On Saturday the 23rd October, the Hackers invade The Space!
In association with [QUESTS](http://bit.ly/QUB_QUESTS), [Dragonslayers](http://bit.ly/dragonslayers), and [IETNI](http://bit.ly/IETNI), [HackerspaceBelfast](http://hackerspaces.org/wiki/HackerspaceBelfast) will be running a series of events over 24 hours of software, network, and hardware hackery goodness, as well as screening hacker movies, DIY repair, and maybe, just maybe, how to build a laser. Running parallel to [Dragonslayers' 24 hour gaming event,](http://bit.ly/QUBDS24) which will incorporate console, PC, and tabletop games, attendees will be able to both play and make games to their hearts content.

If you're interested in programming, like to take things apart and see what happens if you mess with hardware, or want to know more about some of the the pitfalls of network and computer security (as well as how to prevent them), come along and mess with a group of like minded people.
Admission is Â£5 to pay for security and utilities. Space is limited so come early, stay late, and you won't be disappointed. The ball starts rolling at 12 noon on Saturday.
For more information or to register your interest, check out our [Facebook Event](http://bit.ly/hackathonNI), Our [Wiki](http://hackerspaces.org/wiki/HackathonBelfast), or the [Google Group](http://groups.google.com/group/belfast-hackspace-working-group) and get involved!
