I had a bit of a surprise logging into my weekly stats-fest that is my [Google Analytics](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google%20Analytics) account; 300% rise in Search Based traffic. My daily traffic is meagre to say the least but still, to see such a jump on the week-on-week numbers is always a good thing.

But I, like alot of people in this field, like knowing why! My first thought was that [Google had recently sent out a press release](http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2010/05/this-week-in-search-5110.html) governing updated search characteristics, and while I didn't see anything relevant to my site in particular, its possible that general algorithmic tweaks could have slid me up the rankings.

Unfortunately I wasn't satisfied with that explanation as it doesn't explain that that 300% spike happened over one day; the 29th of April.   15 Visitors on the 28th, 55 on the 29th, Why? What happened on that day that would [send](http://www.andrewbolster.info/tag/ubuntu/) people to my [blog](http://www.andrewbolster.info/2010/03/my-experience-with-ubuntu-10-04-lucid-lynx/)?

Guess [when Ubuntu Lucid Lynx 10.04 LTS went out for final release](http://www.ubuntugeek.com/ubuntu-10-04lucid-lynx-release-schedule.html).

Mystery solved. Of course if I had taken a closer look at the keywords it might have become obvious
