So, what are they going to do with all those '[NI 2012: Our Time Out Place](http://ni2012.com/)' things?

Is it no longer our place? Are we joining up with the republic or the mainland or something?

Are we all getting deported?! I DON'T WANT TO BE DEPORTED!

Who am I Kidding, yes, I do, this place sucks sometimes between [flegs](http://sluggerotoole.com/2012/12/14/flegs-unrest-protest-and-threats-are-the-price-we-pay-for-not-giving-moderates-a-voice/) and [riots](http://i.imgur.com/9l3qe.jpg) and [expenses](http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/local-national/northern-ireland/stormont-mlas-are-split-over-plan-to-raise-wages-but-cut-their-allowances-16237219.html) and [planning permission](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-17285196) and [investment funds](http://www.kernelmag.com/features/report/3347/inside-invest-ni-part-iii-too-big-to-fail/) and [floods](http://i.imgur.com/GdWma.jpg).

Thanks to those who made 2012 suck less, especially everyone who has contributed to [Farset](http://farsetlabs.org.uk) and all that jazz, it really has been a dream come true.

All the best, blah blah blah, see you next year!
