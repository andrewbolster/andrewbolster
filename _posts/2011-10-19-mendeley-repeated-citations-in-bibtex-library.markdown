title: Mendeley Repeated Citations in BibTeX Library
---


Problem: Had two citations with slightly different information appearing in library.bib, causing bibtex to shit itself, but only one citation appeared in the desktop / web interfaces
Cause: 'Deleted' Library items still appear in library.bib, so old (custom) version of citation still persisted after being 'removed'
Solution: Empty trash
