Inspired byÂ [Barry Haughey's](http://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=533924992) recent facebook post;

Dear International Banking Conglomerates and other major employers,

I just spent 3 hours of my life writing custom cover letters, answering pointless assessment questions, and entering my 'skillsets' on 4 different occasions for an application for one job... Just gimme the bloody job already; you're big enough and ugly enough to have been able to pick up all that infomation from either a) My extensive and detailed resume, b) my attached university transcript.

For companies whose bread and butter is data management and analysis, wise the hell up;

Why not just pull all the information from my LinkedIn page?

What about having a standardized assessment test that everyone can use, and do, ONCE, and then you pull their score from that profile?

What about taking all that time that people waste putting THE SAME INFORMATION over and over and over again, and using that time to, I dunno, study to get a better degree?

That way, you get the BEST candidates, not the ones who spray their CV's around like a bedwetting ADHD-sufferring 5 year old.

Yours Exhaustedly

Andrew Bolster
