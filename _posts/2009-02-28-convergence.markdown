So, I've made the plunge and am determined to catch up on everything I've left behind the past couple of years.

I have embraced the new interconnections,

[Twitter](http://www.twitter.com/bolster),[LinkedIn,](http://www.linkedin.com/in/andrewbolster) [Facebook](http://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=339300358),

Facebook is personal, LinkedIn will be exclusivly business, And as wel all know twitter is a free for all.
