![](/img/ericsson.png)

#### Software Test Engineer (2008 - 2009)

Implementation of an Agile, Unit-tested and Continuously Integrated product release cycle to global 4G test infrastructure, reducing pre-deployment testing from three days to less than an hour, with fully automated reporting for a proprietary deployment application. I later moved on to server-side performance benchmarking for multi-gigabyte aggregation applications built on MySQL and Erlang. Participated in deployment planning for internal migration from SPARC to Solaris x86 porting, where my automated testing systems greatly improved the speed and confidence of this migration.

## Education

### University of Liverpool

![](/img/livuni.png)

#### PhD Researcher (2013 - 2016)

*"An Investigation into Trust and Reputation Frameworks for Collaborative Teams of Autonomous Underwater Vehicles"*

Working in the area of trust and security in telecommunications and autonomous networks for marine environments as part of a joint UK-FR PhD programme.

The programme was agreed at the 2010 Anglo-French Summit as one of the ten priorities in 2011 for the Anglo French Defence Research Group (AFDRG).

Included collaborations with:

* National Physical Laboratory (NPL) and Plextek Ltd. on Enhanced Kalman Filtering for acoustic marine localisation in GPS denied environments.
* NATO Centre for Maritime Research and Experimentation on REMUS payload scoping and potential malicious misbehaviours of autonomous AUVs

### Queen's University Belfast
