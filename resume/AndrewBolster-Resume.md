## Experience

### TOM Ltd, Belfast / Liverpool, UK

####Associate / Product Manager (PT 2012 - 2014)

Traffic Observation and Management is a university spin-out company specialising in advanced wireless security systems for the public hotspot and payments services industries.

Contributed to ongoing development and refinement of the core SpriteGuard product structure and marketing, including stakeholder discussion and trade show representation.

In addition, as part of a Centre for Defence Enterprise (UK) call, took part in a collaborative development programme with National Physical Laboratories (NPL, Teddington) and Plextek Ltd, (Cambridge) around the development of dynamic localisation in GPS-denied environments for marine platforms.

### Farset Labs, Belfast, UK

####Founder/Director (PT 2011 - Present)

Created Farset Labs in response to a demonstrated need for an independent, non-profit, charitable community of technology innovators, providing them a open space and shared resources to experiment, explore, and grow themselves, their projects, and relationships with local and global business. 

Building Farset Labs as a hub for the tech community in Belfast and Northern Ireland as a whole, ensuring that the organisation remains agile and true to its core values.

Currently Farset Labs stands as a valued part of the technology, entrepreneurship, and STEM outreach communities, with collaborations with academia, government, and the private sector across Northern Ireland

### Defence Science and Technology Laboratory, Portsdown West, UK

####Summer Secondment: Analyst (2013) 

Coordinating research between Information Management and Naval Systems departments to synthesize an approach towards maritime autonomy.

Culminated in significant contribution to a Five-Eyes Autonomy Exchange project.

### PC Engines GmbH, Zurich, Switzerland

####Summer Secondment: Embedded Developer (2011)

Implementing and prototyping next generation embedded computing platforms and contributing to the Coreboot, SerialICE and FlashROM Open source Projects.

### Navigator Blue, Belfast, UK

### Ericsson LMI, Athlone, ROI

![](/img/ericsson.png)

#### Year in Industry: Software Test Engineer (2008 - 2009)

Working to streamline the product release cycle from a waterfall style development to a more Agile, incremental system. In my work i have reduced release testing time from three days to half an hour, with fully automated reporting for a Proprietary client application. I later moved on to server-side performance benchmarking for multi-gigabyte aggregation applications built on MySQL. During this time, I implemented testing strategies not only for the client devices, but also for that test suite itself, and a 'watchdog' system for the server-side processing; this was very useful as during my time at Ericsson, they made the migration from Solaris SPARC to Solaris x86, and my automated testing systems greatly sped up the integration testing of the migration.

## Education

### University of Liverpool
