## Experience

### TOM Ltd, Belfast / Liverpool, UK
![](/img/spriteguard.png)

#### Associate / SpriteGuard Product Manager (PT 2012 - 2014)

Traffic Observation and Management is a university spin-out company specialising in advanced wireless security systems for the public hotspot and payments services industries.

Contributed to ongoing development and refinement of the core SpriteGuard product structure and marketing, including stakeholder discussion and trade show representation.

In addition, as part of a Centre for Defence Enterprise (UK) call, took part in a collaborative development programme with National Physical Laboratories (NPL, Teddington) and Plextek Ltd, (Cambridge) around the development of dynamic localisation in GPS-denied environments for marine platforms.

### Farset Labs, Belfast, UK

![](/img/farsetlabs.png)

#### Founder/Director (PT 2011 - Present)

Created Farset Labs in response to a demonstrated need for an independent, non-profit, charitable community of technology innovators, providing them a open space and shared resources to experiment, explore, and grow themselves, their projects, and relationships with local and global business. 

Building Farset Labs as a hub for the technology community in Belfast and Northern Ireland as a whole, ensuring that the organisation remains agile and true to its core values.

Currently Farset Labs stands as a valued part of the technology, entrepreneurship, and STEM outreach communities, with collaborations with academia, government, and the private sector across Northern Ireland

### Defence Science and Technology Laboratory, Portsdown West, UK

![](/img/dstl.png)

#### Summer Secondment: Analyst (2013) 

Coordinating research between Information Management and Naval Systems departments to synthesize a coordinated, data driven approach towards maritime autonomy and its potential applications.

Culminated in significant contribution to a Five-Eyes Autonomy Exchange project.

### PC Engines GmbH, Zurich, Switzerland

![](/img/PC-Engines.png)

#### Summer Secondment: Embedded Developer (2011)

Implementing and prototyping next generation embedded computing platforms and contributing to the Coreboot, SerialICE and FlashROM Open source Projects.

### Navigator Blue, Belfast, UK

![](/img/blu.png)

#### Technical Consultant (PT 2009-2010)

Application of technical knowledge and experience around Social Marketing and Customer Relationship Management to a leading Marketing and Advertising Firm. Responsibilities included strategic report generation for the creative director around the growth of social media marketing, relevant technologies such as Google Analytics for performance stracking and RFID / Smart Phone / Geo-location for targeted advertising. Directly contributed and presented at tender presentations.

### Ericsson LMI, Athlone, ROI

![](/img/ericsson.png)

#### Software Test Engineer (2008 - 2009)

Implementation of an Agile, Unit tested and Continuously Integrated product release cycle to global 4G test infrastructure, reducing pre-deployment testing from three days to less than an hour, with fully automated reporting for a proprietary deployment application. I later moved on to server-side performance benchmarking for multi-gigabyte aggregation applications built on MySQL and Erlang. Participated in deployment planning for internal migration from SPARC to Solaris x86 porting, where my automated testing systems greatly improved the speed asnd confidence of this migration.

## Education

### University of Liverpool
