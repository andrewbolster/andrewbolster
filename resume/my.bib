abstract = {In this paper, we demonstrate the need for multi-metric trust assessment in Underwater Autonomous Networks (UAN). Many UANs use MANET architectures, however the marine environment presents new challenges for trust management frameworks that have been developed for use in conventional (i.e. Terrestrial RF) MANETs. We investigate the operation of a selection of traditional MANET TMFs in this environment. We characterise these challenges and present results that demonstrate a multi-metric approach to Trust greatly enhances the effectiveness of TMFs in these environments.},
