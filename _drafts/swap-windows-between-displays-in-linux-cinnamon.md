I've had a [long standing problem](http://askubuntu.com/questions/141752/keyboard-shortcut-to-move-windows-between-monitors) with Linux. Used to be there was a keyboard shortcut for sending windows to multiple monitors (the link explains it better), but needless to say it disappeared. 

In the intervening time, there weren't many 'real' solutions, and the listed answer has been broken on other systems for a while. Unfortunately I've also moved on to [LinuxMint](http://linuxmint.com) using [Cinnamon](http://cinnamon.linuxmint.com/) as the window manager, so that's not exactly a great solution.

I found that there was an issue raised against [Cinnamon](https://github.com/linuxmint/Cinnamon/issues/2190) to solve exactly this problem, but the open source community simultaneously slow to move and impatient, [Contribucious](https://github.com/linuxmint/Cinnamon/issues/2190#issuecomment-19863084) presented a great 'interim' [solution], basically constructing a manual keyboard shortcut to a script that did it all for you.

TL;DR, and pretty much a note for me later
